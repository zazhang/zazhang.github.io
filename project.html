                    <p class="text-left">Recent systemic failures in different domains continue to remind us of the fragility of complex sociotechnical systems. Although these failures occurred in different domains, there are common failure mechanisms that often underlie such events. Hence, it is important to study these disasters from a unifying systems engineering perspective so that one can understand the commonalities as well as the differences to prevent or mitigate future events. A new conceptual framework that systematically identifies the failure mechanisms in a sociotechnical system, across different domains is proposed. Our analysis includes multiple levels of a system, both social and technical, and identifies the potential failure modes of equipment, humans, policies, and institutions. With the aid of three major recent disasters, how this framework could help us compare systemic failures in different domains and identify the common failure mechanisms at all levels of the system is demonstrated.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The recent financial crisis, and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis, once again highlighted that understanding the potential instabilities in the financial system is of great societal value. Financial instability typically results from positive feedback loops intrinsic to the operation of the financial system. The challenging task of identifying, modeling and analyzing the causes and effects of such feedback loops requires a proper systems engineering perspective that is lacking in the remedies proposed in recent literature.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">We propose that signed directed graphs (SDG), a modeling methodology extensively used in process systems engineering, is an appropriate framework to address this challenge. The SDG framework is able to represent and reveal information missed by more traditional network models of financial system. This framework adds crucial information to the edges in a network in terms of the direction of flows, and relationship between the variables associated with the nodes at the two ends of a directed edge; thereby providing a framework for systematically analyzing the potential hazards and instabilities in the system.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Global public health events such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak raises concerns about Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) preparedness and the effectiveness of the response across the world. EIDs preparedness and response require public health coordination and communication, which face the challenge of knowledge sharing and reuse. While many studies have been done on public health surveillance or meta-knowledge analysis, limited progress has been made in knowledge management of public health documents. The complexity of public health knowledge is the major barrier. Similar information management problem has been studied in chemical engineering and biological science for years. Engineers and scientists address this problem by designing an ontology that facilitates knowledge management.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">In this work, we propose a systems engineering inspired Ontology-driven Knowledge Management approach. This approach decomposes public health knowledge into concepts and relations and stores them in a function-based manner in an ontology. Semantic rules enable knowledge retrieval with respect to usersâ€™ queries. This novel approach takes a systems engineering perspective to manage public health knowledge. The function-based knowledge representation reduces the hierarchical complexity as well as the heterogeneity of public health knowledge. A West Nile Virus (WNV) outbreak scenario has been studied, and the reasoning results are compared with lessons learned from 1999 WNV outbreak in New York City. The comparison demonstrates the capability of this approach.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">A number of systemic failures, such as the Global Financial Crisis, BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and the Northeast Power Blackout, share surprising similarities in the failure mechanisms. Such similarities call for a unified framework that can describe, model, and more importantly, manage systemic risks across domains. One of the challenges in developing such a framework is creating a universal representation, which can describe components, relationships, and emergent behaviors of a complex system. The representation should also take into consideration the human factors. Existing methods are generally suitable only for modeling a subset of complex systems. For example, equations describe system dynamics while digraph-based techniques deal with causal relationships.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">In this work, we propose such a unified modeling framework by combining system teleology with axiomatic set theory. The framework abstracts elements of sociotechnical systems as sets and models system teleology as nonlinear relations. Using this framework, we can demonstrate the underlying process of emergence -- an essential element of systemic risk. We illustrate our approach using several case studies.</p>
